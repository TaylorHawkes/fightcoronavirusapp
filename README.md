# fightcoronavirusapp

This is a ios/android app built to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
It would be great if others developers want to get involved. 
Currently the idea is to help identify breakout areas, and then notify people in those areas to take increased 
preventive messures. App Users input if they are sick along with their location, then those breakouts are shown on this
map http://www.fightcoronavirusapp.com. 

The app also offers limited information on prevention tips. Here are some other features that could be helpful:
1. Community support system - People who are sick can request things they need such as a meal or tylenol and local app users can help. 
2. Notification and alert systems for important information and breakouts. 
3. Additional preventitive tips.
4. .... open to helpful suggestions.
